*PLease note: to access the site, you have to use tor browser*

**The Hidden Wiki** is always a perfect entrance for those who wanna enter the onion services and the socalled darknet. I would like to refer you to the new onion v3 site. I always bookmark it. It stays fresh with onion links. I used to lost onion v2 websites when tor websites updated to v3. The Hidden Wiki helpd me to recollet these sites. I can't find a site that could replace the Hidden Wiki.

*Another thing you should notice: The Hidden Wiki **does not verify or mark services** in any way*

## Bookmark it and spreed it !

Hope we can create a good new internet.
